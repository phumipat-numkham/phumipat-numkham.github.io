## 🚀 Highlight Initiative – Risk Guardian (GPT AI IPR Detection)

### Project Risk Guardian: GPT AI Intellectual Property Detection  
- Designed and implemented GPT-based AI solutions to detect **unauthorized and counterfeit products** using both **text and image signals**.
- Helped build an automated IPR screening pipeline for high-risk listings.
- The project:
  - **Mitigated up to USD 1M in fines per brand**
  - **Reduced total legal exposure by ~USD 950M**
- Recognized as **Winner of Shopee Outstanding Project Awards 2025**.

This is one of the initiatives I am most proud of, as it delivered both **strong business impact** and **structural risk reduction** for the platform.

## 🤖 AI & Automation Projects

### 1. Listing IPR AI Classification System (n8n + NLP)

Automated the classification of brand-owner complaint statements for new IPR cases.

- Built an AI Agent (via n8n) to **read complaint text**, identify key signals (e.g. *fake, counterfeit, copy*), and classify cases into 4 IP types.
- Continuously refined prompts and logic to improve model behavior.
- Achieved **97% classification accuracy**, significantly reducing human misclassification.
- Eliminated ~4 hours/day of repetitive manual review for agents.

### 2. AI-Driven Counterfeit Item Detection System

Developed a **three-layer AI workflow** to flag potential counterfeit listings automatically.

- **NLP Layer:** Detects brand names and patterns from noisy item titles and descriptions.  
- **Computer Vision Layer:** Recognizes logos and brand imagery from cover images.  
- **Business Rules Layer:** Compares prices against brand price floors (e.g., 50% threshold) to determine risk.  

**Impact:**
- Streamlined a previously manual, labor-intensive process.
- Improved **detection speed, consistency, and coverage** for high-risk items.
