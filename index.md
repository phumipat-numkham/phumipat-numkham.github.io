## 🤖 AI & Automation Projects

### 1. Listing IPR AI Classification System

Automated the classification of brand-owner complaint statements for IPR cases, **fully replacing manual agent decision-making**.
- Designed and built an **AI Agent (n8n + NLP)** to read complaint text and classify cases into **Counterfeit, Trademark, Patent, or Copyright** using keyword and contextual analysis.
- Led **prompt design, rule definition, and iterative accuracy tuning** to ensure consistent and compliant decisions.
- Achieved **97% classification accuracy** with 2–3 seconds per case (vs. ~70 seconds manually).

**Impact**
- **100% replacement of agent IP Type classification**
- Eliminated **~4 hours/day** of manual review work
- Enabled agents to focus entirely on **higher-value exception handling and quality control**
- Improved **consistency, compliance, and auditability** by removing human bias and fatigue

### 2. AI-Driven Counterfeit Item Detection System

Automated counterfeit item detection to **replace manual screening and close gaps left by existing internal models**.
- Designed and implemented a three-layer AI detection system to identify counterfeit listings end-to-end:
  - **AI Agent 1 – Text Brand Detection:** Detects brand names in titles and descriptions, including misspellings and Thai language variations.  
  - **AI Agent 2 – Image Logo Detection:** Identifies brand logos in product images even when brand names are not explicitly stated in text. 
  - **AI Agent 3 – Price Anomaly Check:** Flags listings priced ≥50% below authentic brand benchmarks as high counterfeit risk.
- Integrated outputs from all agents into a single automated decision flow to minimize reliance on manual review.

**Impact:**
- **100% automated counterfeit screening** for high-risk listings
- Significantly **reduced manual agent review dependency** and review latency
- Improved **detection coverage and consistency**, addressing blind spots in the existing internal model
- Reduced risk of counterfeit items remaining live due to **human oversight or judgment error**
