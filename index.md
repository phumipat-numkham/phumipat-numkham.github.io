## 🤖 AI & Automation Projects

### 1. Listing IPR AI Classification System (n8n + NLP)

Automated the classification of brand-owner complaint statements for new IPR cases.

- Built an AI Agent (via n8n) to **read complaint text**, identify key signals (e.g. *fake, counterfeit, copy*), and classify cases into 4 IP types.
- Continuously refined prompts and logic to improve model behavior.
- Achieved **>99% classification accuracy**, significantly reducing human misclassification.
- Eliminated ~2 hours/day of repetitive manual review for agents.

### 2. AI-Driven Counterfeit Item Detection System

Developed a **three-layer AI workflow** to flag potential counterfeit listings automatically.

- **NLP Layer:** Detects brand names and patterns from noisy item titles and descriptions.  
- **Computer Vision Layer:** Recognizes logos and brand imagery from cover images.  
- **Business Rules Layer:** Compares prices against brand price floors (e.g., 50% threshold) to determine risk.  

**Impact:**
- Streamlined a previously manual, labor-intensive process.
- Improved **detection speed, consistency, and coverage** for high-risk items.

### 3. AI-Powered Mall Shop Onboarding System

Designed an AI-supported decision pipeline to pre-screen new shops applying for mall-level onboarding.

- Performed **entity extraction** from unstructured text (brand, company, product info).
- Implemented **IP/trademark match scoring** using public and internal references.
- Used **image analysis** to flag products visually similar to official brand catalogs.
- Combined multiple signals into a **final risk score and decision outcome**:
